#    Projects in progress
##   Ice Runner - A game I'm making with a team of 2 other people from scratch using C++ and Direct X 11.2 
###  Objectve: Create a game that impliments a simple game mechanic from one of your favorite games in childhood.
#### My team and I decided to use a mechanic from Pokemon where the character has to slide around in an ice maze in order to navigate    through parts of an underground tunnel. We are turning that into a two player maze race that allows map creation.
