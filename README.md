##Game Play
The game plays in a split screen mode with seperate controllers. (Currently only works with Xbox controllers)
Each player chooses from a selection of maps for the other player to get through. Ideally each player will have created these maps for eachother, so neither person knows the solution. Whomever makes it through all 5 maps first wins!
